The issue rather appears when you try to cash these funds out... as long as you keep it in Crypto you might not have a problem (until AML policies become in-scope for virtual currency deposit and withdrawals as well), but as soon as you are intent to cash out into FIAT and you either transfer small amounts from any exchange in regular frequency (layering) or bigger amounts in one size that surpasses a certain threshold, AML systems at your bank will most likely be detecting that activity and flag your transactions as suspicious to the compliance department. A compliance officer then put your account on hold and he will then approach the account rep that covers you, that guy might then inform you or not and request evidence that proves the source of funds in order to unblock the account... (this is where you are then supposed to provide extensive documentation from end-to-end) if you obtained those funds as ICO proceeds from supporting a sanctioned regime that also is barred from international capital markets, well depending on jurisdiction that might turn into a problem for you... because all Banks will refuse to process these funds - Mind you: you could try to conceal the truth of the origin of funds, but if a bank finds out, you will be in trouble... as you essentially just attempted money laundering.", "(Maybe you are now starting to see the problem that banks face and why so many rather decide to close out a client instead of keeping him around when they know that he deals in virtual currencies. Verifying the origin of funds generated from crypto is currently for most a manual process, that isn't supported through AML tools, thus exposes everyone to risk (Breaches of AML policies are serious matters as they usually require escalation to regulators with potential fines, if AML regimes aren't sufficiently followed.

A lot of people on this sub and other crypto subs think that trading is easy. 'Sell high, buy low' they say. Yeah, very easy to look at an ATH and bottom of the dip in hindsight and talk about how much better of a position you could be in, but hindsight is 20/20 and more often you're thinking you can do this but end up weakening your position by selling at a presumed ATH that keeps climbing.."], "replTime": "Wed Feb 21 06:25:52 2018 UTC"}

People know the more of these coins they can collect, the more staking rewards they can collect when staking goes live so they really don't necessarily want the coin at $50-100 right now. This coin has gone up to $20+ and dropped down to ~$10-11 multiple times now, and each time I think everyone just enjoys the second/third chance at snagging some coins for cheap because we're confident it's going to at least bounce back to $20 in short order and once staking begins we're confident it will boost far beyond that.

If you have additional service B, that depends on the service A being functional, then.......A better fucking work. LN will not work if the main Bitcoin chain is so unpredictable and delayed (never mind pricey) like it has been recently. On chain scaling is a prerequisite for second layer things to actually work. Full stop. ETH and XMR havn't gimped their main chain, and are fine with on-chain scaling, so I think they stand a much better chance of actually getting the fabled microtransactions model to work. Hell, LN would work even better on BCH rather than BTC. That's the great irony of it.", "I personally have mixed feelings on fluffy. I think a lot of XMR people do. I like his pranks and persistence on XMR staying away from speculators and whatnot. But I absolutely am wary of his closeness with the BTC-core people, and his somewhat wishy-washy statements about on-chain scaling. That said, he's not really THE guy who is coding stuff, and most if not all of the actual developers, researchers, and at least 75% of the rest of the community are on-chain guys, so....whatever I guess. Plus I don't think he's ever really said that ever-smaller blocks are good, like we see so often around here. Just that they should be kept as small as possible while keeping the main chain functional. So it's definitely an issue to keep an eye on, but I'm not worried too terribly much about that.
